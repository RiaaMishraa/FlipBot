Team - High Voltage

We are well aware that the topic was to create a voice bot...
Rasa, the open source machine learning framework that we have used, has its own assistant called Sara.
We wanted to use Sara to further add the voice part but weren't able to install it on either Mac, Windows or Linux.
The code and video that we have submitted are for a ChatBot rather than a Voice bot.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to make something great.
We are really grateful for this opportunity.
